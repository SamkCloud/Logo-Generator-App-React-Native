# Building/ Maiking of the app
1. I started with the functionality like how I can give data as input and how I can show the Input Data as card.
2. so I used react hooks named useState and Proceed to the next step.
3. which is giving basic Structure like input blocks and cards.
4. for Card "react-native-paper" component is used.
5. and this comes to Adding Gradient to cards. which is resolved by the react-native linear Gradient component.
6. after that color pallets is chosen for cards and then the tricky step comes.
7. in which I have created another list used as buttons for changing card gradient Themes by clicking on them. 
8. I linked the colors of both lists by props. and my whole code is written in the functional components.
9. when This theme Functionality starts working. I have shifted to card fonts and background images and styles. This is the most time-consuming task because whenever you are testing desing app crases multiple times, which is the most frustrating part... but let's leave that and come to the Nearly End Part.
10. Adding the heading of the App and color Button Info. for Better UI. 
11. I have Created this UI in Most simplest Way a user Can UnderStand and use it.
12. but I have Some Functionality for the next Update Cards Popup View. using {Mondal, Pressable, alert} and Text Theme Change and some more themes of cards with more icons.
13. and that's How i completed my App Building.
